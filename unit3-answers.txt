BEGIN:ck
The client-server architecture:
Server connect a router and a wi-fi access point
The router and wi-fi access point both get switch to distribution of port for each equipment
Then the router connect host and wi-fi access point connect get though the switch
host usually link interent by network Cable and laptop by wi-fi due to ardware features, so I send host with a router and
laptop with wi-fi access point.
