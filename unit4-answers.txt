# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'symmetric encryption'
BEGIN:ab
Symmetric encryption is a one type of encryption, the other one is asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption only uses one secret key to encrypt and decrypt data/information. To use the key, the community entities must exchange the key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses one public and one private key to encrypt and decrypt information.

To use symmetric encryption algorithms, the data can convert a type which anyone cannot be able to read without a key. When the recipient or who has the key gets the data, the algorithms start decryption data to let data able to read. The sender and recipient are all able to use specific or random code for their secret key.

The two types of symmetric encryptionâ€“ block algorithms and stream algorithms. Here are some examples of symmetric encryption, such as advanced encryption standard (AES), International data encryption algorithm (IDEA), Rivest cipher 4(RC4), RC5 and RC6.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'revocation certificates'
BEGIN:ac
Certificate revocation is a process to let certificates invalidate before the scheduled expiration date. Here is a list for certificate revocation, it is called certificate revocation list (CRL). If the digital certificates revoked before the expiration date can't be trusted anymore, the certificate will be in this list. The CRL is a type of blacklist, if the certificate in CRL, the various endpoints would verify the certificate as untrusted. The digital certificates are for the encryption process to secure communications. The certificates usually use the TLS or SSL protocol. There are many reasons to revoke a certificate, such as the certificate is incorrect or the key of the certificate be disclosed.
