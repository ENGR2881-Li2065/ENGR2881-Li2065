# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'symmetric encryption'
BEGIN:ab
Symmetric encryption is a one type of encryption, the other one is asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption only uses one secret key to encrypt and decrypt data/information. To use the key, the community entities must exchange the key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses one public and one private key to encrypt and decrypt information.

To use symmetric encryption algorithms, the data can convert a type which anyone cannot be able to read without a key. When the recipient or who has the key gets the data, the algorithms start decryption data to let data able to read. The sender and recipient are all able to use specific or random code for their secret key.

The two types of symmetric encryption– block algorithms and stream algorithms. Here are some examples of symmetric encryption, such as advanced encryption standard (AES), International data encryption algorithm (IDEA), Rivest cipher 4(RC4), RC5 and RC6.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'revocation certificates'
BEGIN:ac
Certificate revocation is a process to let certificates invalidate before the scheduled expiration date. Here is a list for certificate revocation, it is called certificate revocation list (CRL). If the digital certificates revoked before the expiration date can't be trusted anymore, the certificate will be in this list. The CRL is a type of blacklist, if the certificate in CRL, the various endpoints would verify the certificate as untrusted. The digital certificates are for the encryption process to secure communications. The certificates usually use the TLS or SSL protocol. There are many reasons to revoke a certificate, such as the certificate is incorrect or the key of the certificate be disclosed.

Chrome's address bar defaults to HTTPS

This change started in inversion 90, The address bar in Chrome use https://. The HTTPS more safety than HTTP, this changed improve users’ privacy and loading speed when they are visiting the websites which support the HTTPS. Before use the HTTPS for the defaults, Chrome used HTTP for defaults and this was a practical default, because at the time, most websites didn’t support HTTPS.

Through use HTTPS to default protocol, Chrome improved security and privacy. Chrome able to connect directly to the HTTPS endpoint and don’t need to be redirected, so the loading speed have been improved. If the websites cannot support HTTPS, the Chrome will try HTTPS first then back to HTTP. HTTPS protects encrypting traffic sent over the network, to keep users’ important data not be intercepted and modified.
